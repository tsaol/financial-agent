## Architecture

The system architecture combines several key technologies:

### Why LangGraph?

LangGraph provides several advantages for this agent:

- **Modular Development**: Break down complex financial reasoning into manageable components
- **Intuitive Reasoning Flow**: Program the agent's thought process at the architectural level 
- **Structured Control Flow**: Direct how the agent approaches different financial questions
- **Recursive Processing**: Allow agents to recursively process financial information until reaching a satisfactory answer

### Agent Workflow

The agent employs a ReAct (Reasoning + Action) approach to solve financial queries:

1. Agent receives a financial question from the user
2. Using LangGraph, it structures its reasoning about how to approach the problem
3. It determines what tools might be needed to answer the query
4. It dynamically accesses the necessary MCP tools using a standardized protocol
5. It processes the information recursively, going back to reasoning when needed
6. It presents a comprehensive answer to the user

### MCP Tool Integration

The agent can be extended with various MCP tools for different financial domains:

- **Financial Analysis Tools**: Ratio analysis, trend evaluation, financial statement analysis
- **Stock Market Tools**: Real-time quotes, historical data, technical indicators
- **News Analysis**: Financial news sentiment, market impact predictions
- **Portfolio Management**: Asset allocation, risk assessment, diversification analysis

To add a new MCP server:

1. Click on the settings icon in the UI
2. Enter server name and hostname in the MCP Server Settings dialog
3. Click "Add and Test Server" to validate the connection
